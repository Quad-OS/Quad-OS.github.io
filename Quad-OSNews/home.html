According to the Developers, one of them who is the creator of Quad-OS, Box is meant to be like a blank notebook. When you open it for the first time, its "notebook" is blank, except for a few questions and responses. Now what happens is that while you ask it questions or have a conversation with it, if it does not know how to answer what you said, then it will ask you to give the answer and provide Key Words. What this does is it creates a notebook for Box which is like its database. Additionally, even when you close your browser, or shut down your computer and turn it back on, it will save what is in its "notebook" for the next time you use it. Box can also do Math and tell you the time. As said by the main developer of Box, Kevin C, there are a few more updates to come, one of them to be a major update.</p>
