            <h1>Quad-OS</h1>
            <p>Quad-OS is a web-based operating system. The thing that is special about Quad-OS is that you never have to log into it, as all the data and changes that you make to your version of Quad-OS is saved on the local storage of your computer. What this means is that any changes you make only affect Quad-OS on your computer, and nobody elses.</p>
